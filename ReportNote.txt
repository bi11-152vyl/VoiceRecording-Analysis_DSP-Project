1. What can this program do?
Turning a song file into playable sheetmusic

1st Step: Load the file (format mp3)

2nd: Set a parameter and analyze the window of the song

3rd: down the sample for 10 times using an average filter
It takes out some of the high frequency 
content and decrease the number of points
in the sample to speed up calculations,
especially with FFTs to come.

4th: Threshold the notes
Using a moving average threshold since
some of the notes are significantly louder
than others.
This way we could detect these tall peaks 
while still preserving some of the smaller
but significant notes in the signal.
Go through all of the notes and computed 
the FFT, plotting these we can see some 
of these notes were cleaner than others.

Last step: Play back notes
  
*Notes: 
For helper function:
The function frequency to note took all 
of those frequencies and map them to a
known frequency of a note.
Outputting the string so we are left with
an array of all the notes of the window of
the song

1. Input song:
Have the file in the matlab folder
Dùng lệnh audioread để đọc file với format mp3
chỉnh tốc độ 

2. parameter setting
t1, t2 là các đoạn để cắt thời lượng
đặt t1= 1.0 và t2= 3.3e6

phân tích bài hát theo từng bước:
dùng lệnh audio write để nghe file bản gốc

3. Downsample Note: (giảm âm tần)
Down the sample 10 times (set m = 10)

4. Threshold notes: (loại bỏ các note)

5. Frequencies Notes
Tính frequency của từng nốt 

6. Bback notes:
Tổng hợp các bước trên
